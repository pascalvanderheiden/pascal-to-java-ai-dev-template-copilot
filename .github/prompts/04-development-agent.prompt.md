Create a comprehensive development plan for the Java text adventure game based on the specifications in `/specs/docs/` folder. After creating the development plan ask to commit and push all local changes to GitHub repository before creating issues. Next you can create GitHub issues for all tasks and attach to the epics so that GitHub Copilot can assist in the implementation. Only assign the GitHub Copilot Coding Agent to the first Epic in order, and wait for user input before assigning the Coding Agent to the next Epic. When starting the next Epic, ensure that all sub tasks issues from the previous Epic are closed.
