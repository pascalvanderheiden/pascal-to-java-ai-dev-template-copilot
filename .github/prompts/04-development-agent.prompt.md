Create a comprehensive development plan for the Java text adventure game based on the specifications in `/specs/docs/` folder. After creating the development plan ask to commit and push all local changes to GitHub repository before creating issues. Next you can create GitHub issues and epics so that GitHub Copilot can assist in the implementation. Only assign the GitHub Copilot Coding Agent to the first Epic in order.ÃŸ
